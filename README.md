# Sri Lankan Vehicle Number Plate Detection and Recognition

Sri Lankan Vehicle Plate Detection Model! ðŸš—ðŸ’¡

**Preprocessing:** Handled both videos and images effortlessly using OpenCV to extract frames, laying the groundwork for precise analysis.

**Object Detection:** Utilized a meticulously annotated dataset from RoboFlow to train our model, enabling accurate license plate detection in every image or frame.

**Number Plate Recognition:** Implemented EasyOCR to recognize and extract characters from detected plates, ensuring efficient retrieval of relevant information.

This project has been an incredible learning experience, delving deep into the world of deep learning and gaining invaluable insights along the way. Thrilled to share the progress and results! Stay tuned for more updates!
